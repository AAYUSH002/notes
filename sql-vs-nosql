Architecture 

⬘  SQL Databases are "Relational" while NoSQL databases are "Non-Relational".

⬙  SQL Databases are not mandatorily distributed while NoSQL databases are architected for distributed systems.

Schema

⬘  Schemas in SQL Database is mandatory and, predefined.

⬙  Schemas in NoSQL Database is dynamic. It is not mandatory to define a Schema before creation of data.

Scalability

⬘  SQL Databases are mostly "vertically scalable" means you need to increase the machine's CPU, RAM, Storage for scaling.

⬙  NoSQL Databases are "horizontally scalable" means you just need to add new machines to scale up. NoSQL databases are distributed.

Data Structure

⬘  SQL Databases are Table based.

⬙  NoSQL databases have many variants. There exists Document based, Key-Value based, Wide-Column Store based, Graph based and many other types.

Properties

⬘  SQL Databases are ACID compliant. It means consistency of data is of high priority.

⬙  Where as NoSQL Databases support any 2 of CAP (Consistency, Availability and Partition Tolerance).

 Which one should we use?

⬘  It's not too simple to decide which type of database you should use.

⬙  Mostly we may try to finalise based on

    ❍  Structured Data
    ❍  Scalability
    ❍  Consistency

Structured Data

⬘  Is your data mostly structured? Is it important for you to handle "multi-row transactions"? SQL Databases would be the preferred one.

⬙  Most of the NoSQL databases are better for unstructured and, semi-structured data.

Scalability

If data can grow quickly and you want to scale up immediately on-demand, then NoSQL should be the preferred one.

Consistency

⬘  How important is it for you that your data should always remain consistent?

⬙  Either go for a SQL database or, a NoSQL database which obeys consistency from CAP.
